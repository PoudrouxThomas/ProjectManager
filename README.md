ProjectManager is a demo project that I created to enhance my Symfony skills.

This project primarily emphasizes back-end development, and the front-end intentionally remains basic as it is not the primary focus of this project.

The technologies utilized in this project include Symfony 6, Twig, and Tailwind.

Please see the wiki for more informations.
